#' Chinook Abundance, OR/WA/ID
#'
#' Source Data: Various; see Wells et al. 2014, Table S5. For Oregon, Idaho, and Washington ESUs, data were obtained from the NWFSC's "Salmon Population Summary" database (https://www.webapps.nwfsc.noaa.gov/sps), with additional data for Oregon Coast coho salmon (Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, https://oregonstate.edu/dept/ODFW/spawn/data.htm), and from PFMC (2012) for the Upper Columbia Summer/Fall-run Chinook Salmon. Additional Calculations: Abundance indices are calculated as longterm anomalies (observed mean/standard deviation) of annual escapement by natural origin Spring/Summer-run Chinook salmon to the Snake River system (for list of tributaries, see Wells et al. 2014, Table S5). Data series for multiple subpopulations were standardized by subtracting the series mean and dividing by the series standard deviation. If a consolidated index for the stock was needed we computed an annual weighted average of the standardized series, with weights proportional to the average abundance for each subpopulation., Source Data: Various; see Wells et al. 2014, Table S5.

#' Habitat Compression Index
#'
#' In eastern boundary upwelling ecosystems the spatial footprint of cool upwelled water is regularly demarcated by the differential boundary of warmer oceanic water offshore from cooler coastal water, with upwelling conditions varying with latitude.   Therefore, the goal of the habitat compression index (HCI) is to track the area of cool surface waters as an index of potential 'upwelling habitat' for assessing the spatio-temporal aspects of upwelling.  Upwelling patterns of cold nutrient-rich water are clearly assessed by models and satellite observations and classified spatially by monitoring SST values less than and equal to a monthly resolved temperature threshold.  The HCI tracks the amount of area, determined by the number of grid cells in the model with 2 m surface temperature values less than the monthly temperature threshold, therefore the time series reflects the area of cool water adjacent to the coastline and provides a measure for how compressed cool surface temperatures may be in a particular month.  In this study, we extracted modeled 2 m temperature fields over the domain of each of four regions for each month and tracked the amount of area with temperature values less than and equal to a monthly temperature threshold, resulting in monthly time series starting January 1980.  Monthly temperature thresholds for a given month is the spatial average of 2 m temperature grid cells between the indicated latitude boundaries for each region and from shore out to 75 km for the time period 1980-2010. Cool expansion periods are defined as months with areas exceeding +1 standard deviation (SD) of the full time series, limited cool habitat where area of cool water is less than -1 SD, and periods of habitat compression when the area of cool water falls between the long-term monthly mean and -1 SD.

North Pacific albacore are considered to be one stock throughout the North Pacific Ocean, although some studies have suggested that a northern and southern stock may be present within the assessment area. They are fished throughout their range by multiple countries, mostly using surface gear (troll and pole and line), as well as pelagic longlines and other gears. Their population dynamics are assessed using an age-, length- and sex-structured model (Stock Synthesis v3).

The latest stock assessment report  was completed through the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), using Stock Synthesis V3. The assessment assumes that there is one stock of bigeye in the eastern Pacific. However, the assessment report acknowledges that recent tagging research suggests that bigeye undertake extensive longitudinal movements, which may be at odds with this assumption.

#' Multivariate ENSO Index
#'
#' This calculation is an attempt to monitor ENSO by basing the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) on the six main observed variables over the tropical Pacific. These six variables are: sea-level pressure, zonal and meridional components of the surface wind, sea surface temperature, surface air temperature, and total cloudiness fraction of the sky. These observations have been collected and published in ICOADS for many years. The MEI is computed separately for each of twelve sliding bi-monthly seasons (Dec/Jan, Jan/Feb,..., Nov/Dec). After spatially filtering the individual fields into clusters (Wolter, 1987), the MEI is calculated as the first unrotated Principal Component (PC) of all six observed fields combined. This is accomplished by normalizing the total variance of each field first, and then performing the extraction of the first PC on the co-variance matrix of the combined fields (Wolter and Timlin, 1993). In order to keep the MEI comparable, all seasonal values are standardized with respect to each season and to the 1950-93 reference period.

#' North Pacific High Area
#'
#' Variations in large-scale atmospheric forcing influence upwelling dynamics and ecosystem productivity in the California Current System. The area of the North Pacific High (NPH) is characterized by areal extent of the 1020 Pa isobar (Schroeder et al., doi:10.1002/grl.50100). The area of the NPH are calculated from monthly mean sea level pressure (SLP) fields created by the U.S. Navy Fleet Numerical Meterology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC). Monthly SLP data available at https://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html , search for Dataset ID: erdlasFnWPr. The area is the areal extent of the 1020 hPa contour for a given month. The NRT ROMS temperature data downloaded from the UCSC website (http://oceanmodeling.pmc.ucsc.edu:8080/thredds) has grid points with 2 m temperature data reported as Not-A-Number, these values are 2 m temperatu. Tdata at these grid points are obtained by extrapolating the data to 2 m depth using the interp1d routine from the Python library scipy.interpolate sub-package.

#' North Pacific Gyre Oscillation Index
#'
#' The North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) is a climate pattern that emerges as the 2nd dominant mode of sea surface height variability (2nd EOF SSH) in the Northeast Pacific. The NPGO is significantly correlated with previously unexplained fluctuations of salinity, nutrients and chlorophyll-a measured in long-term observations in the California Current (CalCOFI) and Gulf of Alaska (Line P). We use the term NPGO because its fluctuations reflect changes in the intensity of the central and eastern branches of the North Pacific gyre circulations as evident from the NPGO SSHa anomalies. Fluctuations in the NPGO are driven by regional and basin-scale variations in wind-driven upwelling and horizontal advection- the fundamental processes controlling salinity [figure] and nutrient [figure] concentrations. Nutrient fluctuations drive concomitant changes in phytoplankton concentrations, and may force similar variability in higher trophic levels. The NPGO thus provides a strong indicator of fluctuations in the mechanisms driving planktonic ecosystem dynamics.

#' 2020 Forage Biomass, California Current North
#'
#' Source Data: Dr. Brian Burke (NOAA; brian.burke@noaa.gov); derived from surface trawls taken during NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center Juvenile Salmon & Ocean Ecosystem Survey (JSOES).  Additional calculations by Cheryl Morgan (OSU - CIMRS; cheryl.morgan@oregonstate.edu). Partial funding is from the Bonneville Power Administration (1998-014-00). Additional Calculations: Jellyfish data from 1998 were not reliably recorded and are not included in this analysis. To be included in this analysis, stations must have been 1) sampled during the day time, 2) on the continental shelf (greater than 200 m water depth), and 3) sampled during at least half of the years of the JSOES effort. Sampling occurs from the northern tip of Washington (48N 13.7') down to Newport, Oregon (44N 40.0') in late June. A Nordic 264 rope trawl (Nor'Eastern Trawl Systems, Bainbridge Island, WA) is towed at the surface (upper 20 m) for 15 - 30 min at approximately 6.5 km/hr. The total abundance for each nekton species caught in each haul was either determined directly or estimated from the total weight of the species in a catch and the weight and number of individuals in a subsample of that catch.  Trawl catches were standardized to linear density by dividing catch of each species at a station by the distance between the start- and endpoints of the tow as determined by a global positioning system receiver and log10 transformed (Log10(no. km-1+ 1)).

#' California Current Marine Heatwave Event List
#'
#' Marine heatwaves, or MHWs, occur when ocean temperatures are much warmer than usual for an extended period of time; they are specifically defined by differences in expected temperatures for the location and time of year. MHWs are a growing field of study worldwide because of their effects on ecosystem structure, biodiversity, and regional economies. Developed by oceanographers from NOAA Fisheries' Southwest Fisheries Science Center as an experimental tool for natural resource managers, the California Current MHW Tracker is a program designed to understand, describe, and provide a historical context for the 2014-16 blob. It also produces a range of indices that could help forecast or predict future MHWs expected to impact our coast.

Although decennial census data represent an estimate at a specific date, the ACS data are period estimates, collected over an entire year and are potentially averaged over varying time periods, depending on the size of the geographic area (U.S. Census Bureau, 2009).  Given that communities of interest include geographic areas with populations less than 20,000, ACS data at the Census-Designate Place level or for place-based communities, are averaged over a five-year period., Additional Calculations:  The Community Social Vulnerability Index (CSVI) is derived from social vulnerability indices (e.g., personal disruption, poverty, population composition, housing characteristics, housing disruption, labor force structure, and natural resource labor force).

Additional calculations by Cheryl Morgan (OSU - CIMRS; cheryl.morgan@oregonstate.edu). Partial funding is from the Bonneville Power Administration (1998-014-00). Additional Calculations: Jellyfish data from 1998 were not reliably recorded and are not included in this analysis. To be included in this analysis, stations must have been 1) sampled during the day time, 2) on the continental shelf (greater than 200 m water depth), and 3) sampled during at least half of the years of the JSOES effort. Sampling occurs from the northern tip of Washington (48N 13.7') down to Newport, Oregon (44N 40.0') in late June. A Nordic 264 rope trawl (Nor'Eastern Trawl Systems, Bainbridge Island, WA) is towed at the surface (upper 20 m) for 15 - 30 min at approximately 6.5 km/hr. The total abundance for each nekton species caught in each haul was either determined directly or estimated from the total weight of the species in a catch and the weight and number of individuals in a subsample of that catch.  Trawl catches were standardized to linear density by dividing catch of each species at a station by the distance between the start- and endpoints of the tow as determined by a global positioning system receiver and log10 transformed (Log10(no. km-1+ 1)).

#' North Pacific High Area, January - February Mean
#'
#' Variations in large-scale atmospheric forcing influence upwelling dynamics and ecosystem productivity in the California Current System.The area of the North Pacific High (NPH) is characterized by areal extent of the 1020 Pa isobar. Winter values (January - February mean) of the NPH area can be used as an ecosystem pre-conditioning index (Schroeder et al., doi:10.1002/grl.50100).The area of the NPH are calculated from monthly mean sea level pressure (SLP) fields created by the U.S. Navy Fleet Numerical Meterology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC). Monthly SLP data available at https://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html , search for Dataset ID: erdlasFnWPr. The area is the areal extent of the 1020 hPa contour for a given month. The January - February mean is the average of the January and February areas for a given year. The NRT ROMS temperature data downloaded from the UCSC website (http://oceanmodeling.pmc.ucsc.edu:8080/thredds) has grid points with 2 m temperature data reported as Not-A-Number, these values are  2 m temperatu. Tdata at these grid points are obtained by extrapolating the data to 2 m depth using the interp1d routine from the Python library scipy.interpolate sub-package.

#' Streamflow - Annual 1-day maximum flow anomaly
#'
#' Streamflow is measured using active USGS gages (https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/sw) with records that meet or exceed 30 years in duration.Average daily values from 213 gages were used to calculate annual 1-day maximum flows.  These indicators correspond to flow parameters to which salmon populations are most sensitive.  Standardized anomalies of time series from individual gages were then averaged to obtain weighted averages for ecoregions (for which HUC-8 area served as a weighting factor) and for the entire California current (weighted by ecoregion area).

#' California Current Marine Heatwave, EEZ regions Daily
#'
#' Marine heatwaves, or MHWs, occur when ocean temperatures are much warmer than usual for an extended period of time; they are specifically defined by differences in expected temperatures for the location and time of year. MHWs are a growing field of study worldwide because of their effects on ecosystem structure, biodiversity, and regional economies. Developed by oceanographers from NOAA Fisheries' Southwest Fisheries Science Center as an experimental tool for natural resource managers, the California Current MHW Tracker is a program designed to understand, describe, and provide a historical context for the 2014-16 blob. It also produces a range of indices that could help forecast or predict future MHWs expected to impact our coast.
