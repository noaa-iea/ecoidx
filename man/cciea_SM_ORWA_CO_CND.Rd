\description{
Source Data:  Various; see Wells et al. 2014, Table S6. For Oregon and Washington ESUs, data were obtained from the NWFSC's "Salmon Population Summary" database (https://www.webapps.nwfsc.noaa.gov/sps), with additional data for Oregon Coast coho salmon (Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, https://oregonstate.edu/dept/ODFW/spawn/data.htm), and from PFMC (2012) for the Upper Columbia Summer/Fall-run Chinook Salmon. Additional Calculations: Proportion of natural-origin spawners, computed for a single population as the fraction NN/NT, where NN is the number of naturally-origin spawners, and NT is the total number of spawners. Population fractions were then averaged across the populations within the ESU, weighted by total spawner abundance.
