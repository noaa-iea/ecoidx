Source Data: Fishery dependence data were provided by Dr. Karma Norman (NOAA), and are derived from state reported fish ticket data as maintained by the Pacific Fishery Information Network (PacFIN) (https://pacfin.psmfc.org/). Additional Calculations: The fishing dependence composite index is based on commercial fishing engagement (a measure of the fishing activity in a community) and commercial fishing reliance (fishing activity relative to population size).
