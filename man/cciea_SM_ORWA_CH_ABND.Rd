Source Data: Various; see Wells et al. 2014, Table S5. For Oregon, Idaho, and Washington ESUs, data were obtained from the NWFSC's "Salmon Population Summary" database (https://www.webapps.nwfsc.noaa.gov/sps), with additional data for Oregon Coast coho salmon (Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, https://oregonstate.edu/dept/ODFW/spawn/data.htm), and from PFMC (2012) for the Upper Columbia Summer/Fall-run Chinook Salmon. Additional Calculations: Abundance indices are calculated as longterm anomalies (observed mean/standard deviation) of annual escapement by natural origin Spring/Summer-run Chinook salmon to the Snake River system (for list of tributaries, see Wells et al. 2014, Table S5). Data series for multiple subpopulations were standardized by subtracting the series mean and dividing by the series standard deviation. If a consolidated index for the stock was needed we computed an annual weighted average of the standardized series, with weights proportional to the average abundance for each subpopulation., Source Data: Various; see Wells et al. 2014, Table S5.

Additional Calculations: Abundance indices are calculated as longterm anomalies (observed mean/standard deviation) of annual escapement by natural origin Chinook salmon to the lower Columbia River system (for list of tributaries, see Wells et al. 2014, Table S5).

Additional Calculations: Abundance indices are calculated as longterm anomalies (observed mean/standard deviation) of annual escapement by natural origin Chinook salmon to the Willamette River system (based on Clackamas and McKenzie River Spring-run Chinook salmon; see Wells et al. 2014, Table S5).
