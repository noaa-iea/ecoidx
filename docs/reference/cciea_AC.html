<meta property="og:description" content="Commercial shipping - distance: source data: Domestic vessel data from U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Navigation Data Center (New Orleans, LA) and foreign vessel data from http://www.ndc.iwr.usace.army.mil/data/dataclen.htm ., additional calculations: Commercial shipping activity (distance) was measured as the distance traveled by commercial vessels during transit within waters of the California Current. Distance traveled was calculated using distance traveled within the California Current while in transit between shipping and receiving ports; Finfish Aquaculture: source data: Washington Department of Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife, Commercial Harvest Data Team, additional calculations: Finfish aquaculture was measured as the production of finfish from aquaculture operations that are located in marine waters. Only the State of Washington currently operates net-pen farms for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar).; Nutrient Input: source data: We used county-level data from 1987 - 2006 and state-level data from 2007 - 2010 from the U.S. Geological Survey (Ruddy et al. 2006, Gronberg and Spahr 2012; http://water.usgs.gov/lookup/getspatial?sir2012-5207_county_fertilizer) and nationwide data (1945 - 2001;  Ruddy et al. (2006)) to develop an index for the California Current across the longer time series., additional calculations: Nutrient input was measured using a normalized index of total nitrogen and phosphorus input from agricultural fertilizers used within watersheds that drain into the California Current.; Oil And Gas Activity: source data: Oil production data come from annual reports of the California State Department of Conservation's Division of oil, gas, and geothermal resources (ftp://ftp.consrv.ca.gov/../pub/oil/annual_reports/), while natural gas production come from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (http://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_prod_sum_dcu_rcatf_a.htm)., additional calculations: Oil and gas activities were measured using a normalized index combining the production of oil and natural gas occurring in offshore sites of California.; Seafood Demand: source data: Data can be found in NOAA's annual Fisheries of the United States reports (http://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/st1/publications.html)., additional calculations: Seafood demand was measured as total consumption or utilization of edible and non-edible fisheries products across the entire United States. We used data from the entire United States as seafood from the California Current is consumed and utilized at national, and even international scales.; Seafood Demand Per Capita: source data: Data can be found in NOAA's annual Fisheries of the United States reports (http://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/st1/publications.html)., additional calculations: Seafood demand was measured as total consumption or utilization of edible and non-edible fisheries products across the entire United States.

    <p>Commercial shipping - distance: source data: Domestic vessel data from U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Navigation Data Center (New Orleans, LA) and foreign vessel data from http://www.ndc.iwr.usace.army.mil/data/dataclen.htm ., additional calculations: Commercial shipping activity (distance) was measured as the distance traveled by commercial vessels during transit within waters of the California Current. Distance traveled was calculated using distance traveled within the California Current while in transit between shipping and receiving ports; Finfish Aquaculture: source data: Washington Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife, Commercial Harvest Data Team, additional calculations: Finfish aquaculture was measured as the production of finfish from aquaculture operations that are located in marine waters. Only the State of Washington currently operates net-pen farms for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar).; Nutrient Input: source data: We used county-level data from 1987 - 2006 and state-level data from 2007 - 2010 from the U.S. Geological Survey (Ruddy et al. 2006, Gronberg and Spahr 2012; http://water.usgs.gov/lookup/getspatial?sir2012-5207_county_fertilizer) and nationwide data (1945 - 2001;  Ruddy et al. (2006)) to develop an index for the California Current across the longer time series., additional calculations: Nutrient input was measured using a normalized index of total nitrogen and phosphorus input from agricultural fertilizers used within watersheds that drain into the California Current.; Oil And Gas Activity: source data: Oil production data come from annual reports of the California State Department of Conservation's Division of oil, gas, and geothermal resources (ftp://ftp.consrv.ca.gov/../pub/oil/annual_reports/), while natural gas production come from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (http://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_prod_sum_dcu_rcatf_a.htm)., additional calculations: Oil and gas activities were measured using a normalized index combining the production of oil and natural gas occurring in offshore sites of California.; Seafood Demand: source data: Data can be found in NOAA's annual Fisheries of the United States reports (http://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/st1/publications.html)., additional calculations: Seafood demand was measured as total consumption or utilization of edible and non-edible fisheries products across the entire United States.
